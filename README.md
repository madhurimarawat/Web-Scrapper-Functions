<h2>Pycharm</h2>

--> Visit the official website of pycharm: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"><img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.c936445e15a65dfdba20a63e14e7df39?rik=fqWqO9kKIVlK7g&riu=http%3a%2f%2fassets.stickpng.com%2fimages%2f58481537cef1014c0b5e4968.png&ehk=dtrTKn1QsJ3%2b2TFlSfLR%2fxHdNYHdrqqCUUs8voipcI8%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" title="PyCharm" alt="PyCharm" width="40" height="40"></a><br><br>
--> Download according to the platform that will be used like Linux, Macos or Windows.<br><br>
--> Two versions of Pycharm are avilable-
1. Community version <br><br>
--> Community version is open source and we can use it for free without any paid plan.<br><br>
--> We can download this at the end of pycharm website.<br><br>
--> After downloading community version we can directly follow the setup wizard and it will be setup.<br><br>
2.  Professional Version.<br><br>
--> This is available at the top of website, we can directly download from there.<br><br>
--> After downloading professional version, follow the below steps.<br><br>
--> Follow the setup wizard and sign up for the free version (trial version) or else continue with the premium or paid version.<br>

### Using Pycharm
--> First, in pycharm we have the concept of virtual environment. In virtual environment we can install all the required libraries or frameworks.<br><br>
--> Each project has its own virtual environment, so thath we can install requirements like Libraries or Framworks for that project only.<br><br>
--> After this we can create a new file, various file types are available in pycharm like script files, text files and also Jupyter Notebooks.<br><br>
--> After selecting the required file type, we can continue the execution of that file by saving it and using this shortcut shift+F10 (In Windows).<br><br>
--> Output is given in Console while installation happens in terminal in Pycharm.

## Streamlit Server

--> Streamlit is a python framework through which we can deploy any machine learning model and any python project with ease and without worrying about the frontend.<br><br>
--> Streamlit is very user-friendly.<br><br>
--> Streamlit has pre defined functions for all frontend components and we can directly use them.<br><br>
--> To install streamlit in your system, just run this command-

```
pip install streamlit
```

## Running Project in Streamlit Server
<p>Make Sure all dependencies are already satisfied before running the app.</p>

1. We can Directly run streamlit app  with the following command-<br>
```
streamlit run app.py
```
where app.py is the name of file containing streamlit code.<br>

By default, streamlit will run on port 8501.<br>

Also we can execute multiple files simultaneously and it will be executed in next ports like 8502 and so on.<br>

2. Navigate to URL http://localhost:8501

You should be able to view the homepage of your app.

🌟 Project and Models will change but this process will remain the same for all Streamlit projects.<br>

## Deploying using Streamlit

1. Visit the official website of streamlit : <a href="https://streamlit.io/"><img src="https://seeklogo.com/images/S/streamlit-logo-1A3B208AE4-seeklogo.com.png" title="Streamlit" alt="Streamlit" width="40" height="40"></a> <br><br>
2. Now make an account with GitHub.<br><br>
3. Now add all the code in Github repository.<br><br>
4. Go to streamlit and there is an option for new deployment.<br><br>
5. Type your Github repository name and specify the file name. If you name your file as streamlit_app it will directly access it else you have to specify the path.<br><br>
6. Now also make sure you upload all your libraries and requirement name in a requirement.txt file.<br><br>
7. Version can also be mentioned like this python==3.9.<br><br>
8. When we mention version in the requirement file streamlit install all dependencies from there.<br><br>
9. If everything went well our app will be deployed on web and you can share the link and access the app from all browsers.
